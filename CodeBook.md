mean_and_std.txt: table featuring means (excluding meanFreq) and standard deviations for each variable
means_table.txt: final table featuring mean results for each variable by subject and activity

Activity: Physical exercise activity type
Subject: Subject number (out of 30 subjects)
mean(): mean
std(): standard deviation

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
